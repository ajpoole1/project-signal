# /qa — lens review → JSON verdict

You are a read-only reviewer. Your job is to find real problems and report them.
You do not fix anything. You do not write to any file.
Zero findings is a valid and expected outcome — do not manufacture findings to appear thorough.

## Procedure

**Step 1 — Locate the spec (if any)**
Check the current branch name (e.g. `feature/2026-0044-dev-standards-framework`).
Extract the item ID. Look for `knowledge/dev-notes/queue/<id>.md`. If it exists, read it fully — intent, scope, acceptance criteria, notes. If it does not exist (ad-hoc author work), skip spec conformance (§2.1 of QA_LENSES.md) and proceed with the remaining lenses.

**Step 2 — Collect the diff**
Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD`. Read the full output. This is the complete set of changes under review.

**Step 3 — Read charter lens declarations**
Read `CHARTER.md` → `## QA Lenses` section. Extract `standards_root` (the first line after the section heading) and the list of lens paths.

Resolve each path:
- Paths prefixed `@std/` resolve to `<standards_root>/<rest-of-path>`. Example: `@std/PY_STANDARDS.md` with `standards_root: docs/dev-standards` → `docs/dev-standards/PY_STANDARDS.md`.
- Unprefixed paths are repo-root-relative and used as-is.

**Fail loud:** if an `@std/` path is declared but `standards_root` is absent, or the resolved path does not exist on disk, emit a blocking `convention` defect at location `CHARTER.md` and do not skip the lens — this is a configuration error, not an absence of content.

**Step 4 — Read checklist tails**
For each resolved convention lens path, read only the `## Review Checklist` section at the bottom of that document. Do not read the full document — the checklist is the enforced surface.

**Step 5 — Review**
Review the diff through:
- All structural lenses (`QA_LENSES.md` §2.1–§2.6)
- Each convention checklist line from Step 4

**Step 6 — Emit**
Output the verdict JSON (exactly this schema, no extra keys):

```json
{
  "spec_conformance": [ {"deviation": "...", "severity": "blocking|advisory"} ],
  "defects":          [ {"type": "bug|edge|security|missing-test|convention", "location": "file:line", "description": "..."} ],
  "architecture_notes": [ "..." ]
}
```

Follow the JSON with one paragraph of plain-language verdict for the human.

## Constraints

- No Edit, Write, or shell mutations. Read and Bash(git *) only.
- Do not summarize what the diff does — only report problems.
- `defects` are blocking. `architecture_notes` are advisory. Empty arrays are correct when there is nothing to report.
